# ðŸ¤– Introduction
Welcome to AgentGPT ðŸ‘‹, an autonomous AI Agent platform that empowers users to create and deploy customizable autonomous AI agents directly in the web.
Simply assign a name and goal to your AI agent, and watch as it embarks on an exciting journey to accomplish the assigned objective.

## How does it work?
AgentGPT works by chaining language models (Agents) to perform a given goal.
Recursively, an agent will think of the best tasks to perform a goal, execute on those tasks, evaluate how it performed, and continually think of more tasks.

## Philosophy
We think the power of AI should be available to everyone and should be driven by community.
This is why we are proudly open source. We'd love to hear your feedback at every step of the journey and the following channels are open for you to reach the team:
