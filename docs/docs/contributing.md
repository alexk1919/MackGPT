# ü§ù Contributing
AgentGPT is proudly open source and we owe much of our success to the community that we've built.
As such, we welcome any and all feedback from crazy ideas to code and design. 
These docs will be updated in time to best describe how to contribute to AgentGPT. 
In the meantime, whether you're a designer, a dev, or anything in between, please reach out to us on [GitHub](https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/jdSBAnmdnY).
